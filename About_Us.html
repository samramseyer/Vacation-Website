    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
      We are a family owned and operated company where we belive that life can
      pull us away from everything that is truly important to us. Family,
      friends, lovers, and even ourselves. We feel like it is so easy to get
      caught up in the every day grind of life that we forget to live and spend
      time on our selves and loved ones. So we created lakeside cabins with
      people in mind. Our Great Grandparents left us a rundown cabin by a lake
      in the 1980s when they passed. When we went to check it out at first we
      were overwhelmed with the work it needed. When we told our friends and
      family about it they thought we should all pitch in to fix it up as a
      retreat/vaction spot. So we all chipped in financially and started taking
      turns enjoying my Great grandparents old cabin then one day we said "hey
      we are not using this all the time lets make it available when we are not
      using it. The next thing we new we were struggling to make room in our
      schedules to visit so we started buying land and adding cabbins every few
      acres hidden behind trees to keep the nature feel and now here we are
      today with 15 cabins none visible from another and thinking about adding
      more.
