    <h1>Our Accomodations</h1>
    <p>
      Here at Lakeside Cabins we believe that seeking a retreat shouldnt be
      stressfull or completly break the bank so for every cabin rental there is
      a small motorized fishing boat parked at the dock, a side by side in the
      garage, and a complimentary bottle of wine in the fridge all included in
      your package. We feel like vacations would be alot more enjoyable if you
      new how much it is going to cost without all the additional hidden fees
      and thats why fishing polls and a small tackle set are in the garage as
      well. Our goal is that if you pick Lakeside Cabins as your choice for a
      retreat we are not going to nikel and dime you every step of the way for
      we feel that takes all the fun out of the retreat. Here you pay one price
      and its all included. Our Cabins come with basic internet,TV, tile shower,
      small kitchen, firplace, and of course a hotub on your patio over looking
      the lake!
